# M4-D4 Homework

## StriveBooks App

1. Make sure to refactor the grid of the books list to have the list on the left and the CommentsArea always visible on the right.
2. Create the initial state for the CommentsArea for when there's no data to be displayed.
3. The CommentsArea behaviour: every time the user clicks on a card a fetch should be perfomed and comments should update. Pass the single ID property and let the Component handle the fetch by using the componentDidUpdate method.
